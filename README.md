# RPG-Game-V2.0
You need to install pygame library for it to work
If you don't know how to install it you can follow the instructions on this link (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pygame-in-windows/)
You have to have the resources (images and font file) in the same file as the source code for it to run
The game autosaves all of your progress and keeps it in save files in the same folder as the source code
